The goal of this project is to create a 24/7 Ai-driven Web-based radio broadcast based on the
BrickMMO Lego city. The radio station will stream its content to a web interface, where anyone
can visit it from their browser, and listen to an AI voice read news stories, weather, and other
happenings around a fictional city.
