# Application Purpose:


The goal of this project is to create a 24/7 Ai-driven Web-based radio broadcast based on the
BrickMMO Lego city. The radio station will stream its content to a web interface, where anyone
can visit it from their browser, and listen to an AI voice read news stories, weather, and other
happenings around a fictional city.

Current Radio website with “listen live” and live player

The radio broadcast will have many of the features of a current real-world radio station, in that it
will support segments. This could include music, games, contests, and even audience
interaction. Listeners would be able to interact with these segments through the website (take
part in polls, play games, etc).

As a developer, this application will focus on showcasing the ability of generative AI models and
how they can be used in tandem to create engaging content. It will also highlight my familiarity
with technology such as CMS development, database security, and API integration.
