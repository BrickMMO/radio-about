## Process

This applciations uses ChatGPT and the Google Text to Voice API to generate an ongoing commentary for the BrickMMO city. 

For this project we are just fixing the About Radio website. This website is coded in Markdown.

---

### Already Completed

The About Radio website already has the About Site Template applied and the Version One documents exist. 

*** 

### Steps

1. The About Radio website home page does not have the correct information on it. Review the [about-flow](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/) website for a sample.

    The home page should not have any links to documents or a list of students/faculty involved.

   THe home page should have a link to the `v1.markdown` file. 

3. Document Names

    The documents in the `v1` folder should be named:

    - radio-v1-pitch.pdf
    - radio-v1-pitch.markdown
    - radio-v1-requirements.pdf
    - radio-v1-requirements.markdown
  
    Make sure to update the links in the `v1.markdown` file.

4. Document Contents

    The two PDF files in the `v1` folder need to be converted to markdown.
